        Look at a sample of your soil. Is it light colored or dark? Is it fine grained? Coarse?
        Does it clump or is it loose? Is it gravelly or rocky? Is there organic material visible in
        it? The appearance of your soil will tell you a lot about its health. Good soil is alive.

        Add enough water to a handful of soil to be able to form it into a ball and knead it enough
        that you can squeeze it without it falling apart. If you can\'t do this, your soil likely
        has a high sand content. If you are able to form a ball, squeeze it between your finger and
        thumb to form a ribbon. The longer you can make the ribbon without it breaking, the higher
        the clay content in your soil.

        Fill a glass or plastic jar that has a tight-fitting lid about halfway up with a sample of
        your soil. Fill it most of the rest of the way up with waterâ€¦and a little bit of dish soap
        to ensure the soil will separate. Put the lid on tight and shake the jar vigorously. Allow
        soil to settle. The sample should form layers, with the heavier components (like gravel and
        clay) settling to the bottom and lighter soils (like sand at the top). The highest level and
        particles floating in suspension will be the organic materials.

        Dig a hole about a foot deep. Inspect the layers you have uncovered. Ideally, you will have
        an organic layer at the top with some uncompacted loam below it and more compacted loam
        layer below that. But, you more likely will have some clay, perhaps some mineral layers
        (like caliche), and gravel or sand in your layers. Hopefully, you will also see some signs
        of life in your soil, like worms! This test will give you an idea how deeply you need to
        work your soil and how much you need to remediate it with organic materials.

    <string name="flood_test_instructions">
        Dig a hole about a foot deep. Fill it up with water. Wait for the water to absorb (usually
        about a day). Now fill the hole about halfway up with water and put a ruler in the hole.
        Measure how much the water level drops over a period that will allow you to caclulate the
        rate of water infiltration, say 10 minutes or 30 minutes. If the water level takes a long
        time to drop, you likely have a very high clay content or a hard mineral layer in your soil.
